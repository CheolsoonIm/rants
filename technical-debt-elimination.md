Accumulating technical debt is easy, just value one cookie today over two cookies tomorrow.

People look for how something was accomplished in the past, copy/paste and quicker than you can say "deadline" they've got a solution.  Except that solution was deprecated in favor of something else and now the level of technical debt has risen. _And that's not their problem._

Their job is to get some code out the door on time and on budget.  If the code does the job, why should the developer care how?  Approximately never has a manager said, "You hit the deadline and came in under budget, but you used the wrong framework."

I watched some homegrown utilities _almost_ go away in favor of vendor-supported solutions.  Then someone fond of the old ways reintroduced them.  This stuff doesn't evaporate unless there's nothing left of it to copy/paste.

And what are the odds that the developer who added to the quantity of technical debt will now have to maintain that debt back out of the code base?

There's a phrase I learned to dread: "As maintenance occurs."  Things no one wants to address are done as maintenance occurs.  Which means never, because maintenance efforts have deadlines too, and those deadlines never take into account the unacknowledged list of things to be done as maintenance occurs.

Long ago in another life I was looking to formalize a list of items well-known within my organization to be remediated as maintenance occurred.  I believed that a comprehensive list would make it plain that any maintenance activity would be overwhelmed by the volume of these ancillary items.

Essentially I wanted a dedicated project to eliminate technical debt, because maintenance efforts never got a chance to address it.  I never got that project.

No doubt you've got your own annoying technical debt list.  Those apps using a deprecated framework that won't go away.  That last app using a now-abandoned JavaScript library.  That homegrown library that just won't die.

You can get rid of your technical debt.  It can be done.  It's easy.  Simple even.  Elimination of technical debt has to be a management priority, because they set the deadlines that don't allow it to be addressed as maintenance occurs.

It's an organizational problem, not a technical one, despite the name.  Staff can't fix organizational problems with [grass-roots efforts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(Animal_Farm)), this one's all on the decision makers.

Are you still running Java 1.8?  Enterprise COBOL 4.2?  DB2 11?  WebSphere 8?  Win7?  WinXP?  Oracle 11?  Is there some sort of memorandum of understanding that indicates such systems are not to be maintained?  Was that signed by managers still on the payroll?

Eventually technical debt will cause a missed deadline, probably a series of them, and/or embarrassment when an application doesn't work, or doesn't work as intended, or leaks PII, or manifests a security problem.  Presented that way, _maybe_ management will make elimination of technical debt a priority.  And if they don't, well, that says something about the values of the organization.

There's no guarantee here.  You can't eliminate risk.  If you eliminate technical debt, you're reducing risk, not eliminating it.

But do not speak to me of eliminating technical debt "as maintenance occurs" -- it is to laugh.  The most common tactic for eliminating technical debt is wishful thinking.

How about let's start trying to do things right?
