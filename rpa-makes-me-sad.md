[Robotic Process Automation (RPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation) makes me sad.  It shows the IT industry doesn't learn from its own mistakes.

In the 1980s, with the rise of the IBM PC and compatibles, we saw the rise of the 3270 emulator which not only began replacing "real" 3270 devices but allowed for the creation of "screen scraping" applications.

Early screen scraping applications proved to be brittle; when the underlying 3270 screens changed, the code that scraped it tended to break and there was no good way for those making the 3270 changes to know their screens were being scraped as many such applications were built outside the IT shop.

This continued into the 1990s and only got worse as "visual programming" tools came into popularity.  Dragging "components" out of a "catalog" and "wiring" them together to create applications, where some of those components were 3270 screens that were being scraped.

This mutated into "choreography" and "orchestration," all of which was sold to management as a way to create applications without needing programmers.  It worked, sort of, but maintenance was a nightmare largely because the "source code" was just icons and lines on a screen.

And now we have RPA, come to fix all the problems of the past and save us from the evil known as the green screen by "learning" the underlying 3270 via user actions.

I'm sure it works, but it doesn't solve the problem.

The problem is that organizations have been and are unwilling to fund investment into their existing application portfolio and instead prefer to metaphorically paint over cracks in the foundation of their business.
