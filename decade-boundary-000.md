For those of you suffering under the onus of some calendar geek trying to convince you that, just as they (or their moral equivalent) told you 20 years ago at the century rollover, the new decade doesn't start until the _end_ of the year ending in 0 not when it begins...

Those people are _wrong_.

As every computer programmer knows, array indicies begin at 0.  There exist programming languages that sprinkle a bit of syntactic sugar over the top of this and allow humans to believe an index begins at 1, but behind the screens everything is 0 based.

This implementation detail is relevant because reality as we know it is not, as is now commonly presumed, a [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis); it is, in fact, a mathematical mapping on top of actual reality being generated by software written in the 19th century by [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) running on hardware constructed by [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage#Analytical_Engine).

Yes, it turns out [mathematics is the basis for everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis).

The hardware, of course, is Babbage's [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).  Thought to be incomplete it was in fact fashioned of brass and hardwood and continues to run (in locked rooms in the crypts beneath Westminster Abbey) Lovelace's reality mapping programs.  The programs reside as holes punched in a continuous stream of vellum, arranged in a MÃ¶bius strip.

The Engine of our reality is kept running by a water wheel powered by an otherwise unrecorded diversion of the eastern branch of the lost [subterranean river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subterranean_rivers_of_London) Tyburn.

Reality, unaugmented by Lovelace's code, is significantly less interesting.  There are only four colors, fewer stars in the firmament, "bitter" is not a flavor; there are other examples of her enhancements recorded in her journals of the time.

We are all in debt to Babbage and Lovelace, and to deny the 0 base is to dishonor them.
