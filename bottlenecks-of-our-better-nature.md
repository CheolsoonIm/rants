People with a [bias for action](https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-03-26) like to point to bottlenecks in an IT process and campaign for their immediate removal.  This is often the case when the campaigner is an advocate of DDD (Deadline Driven Development, you know, like your current "sprint"), instead of what we all know to be the [one true development method](https://github.com/cschneid-the-elder/rants/blob/master/belgian-gambit.md).

Often bottlenecks were placed in the process intentionally; at some point in the past a disaster occurred and the mechanism to prevent same in the future was to introduce a bottleneck, a choke point, a pause for reflection so _someone_ had an opportunity to avert the catastrophe.  Someone with experience.  Someone whose experience is more than superficial.

[The reason is rarely recorded]( https://github.com/cschneid-the-elder/rants/blob/master/recording-why.md).

Sometimes the greatest barriers to success are our own procedures.  And sometimes those procedures are there to prevent disasters.  Just about everyone believes they can differentiate between the two, and they're mostly mistaken in that belief.

Cynics believe the bottlenecks were placed in the process to provide job security, possibly because that's what they themselves would do given the chance.  And they're mostly mistaken too.

Also, if your employer isn't interested in preventing disasters, maybe you should think just a bit harder about your future with that organization.

_Of course_ some of those bottlenecks aren't necessary.  Time passes, no one worries about dropping the deck of punched cards any more.  But don't presume that just because you've encountered an obstacle that it's an evil artifact of a primitive bygone era predating the current enlightenment in which delivery dates are paramount, taking precedence over stability, security, and supportability.

Sometimes there are very good reasons for the way things are, as inconvenient as they may be from your point of view.  Remember that moving fast and breaking things does, in fact, _break things_.  Things that, just maybe, no one wants broken.  Allow for the possibility that, when you were given a mandate to get things done regardless of the consequences, you were drafted into tilting at someone else's windmills.

Security is _hard_. Data integrity is _hard_. Compliance is _hard_. Maintenance, ownership, and governance are _necessary_.  None of this is going to change, because these things are not automatable and require talented, trained, skilled staff.  There seems to be a misconception that the bottleneck in application development is a lack of bodies to do the work, and that any body will do.

Processes evolve to meet the needs dictated by changing conditions.  Evolution is slow and does not ensure an optimal outcome, just one that works.  If you want to remove a bottleneck you really need to know why it's there in the first place.  Because understanding why things are the way they are is a prerequisite to making things how they ought to be.
