"Modernization," or digital transformation by some definitions, of your application portfolio as a euphemism for "rewrite in a more modern language" is an interesting concept.

By all means, feel free to reimplement your existing mainframe business application portfolio (which is very likely mostly COBOL or PL/I) in something perceived to be more "modern."  IBM Z has Java and Node.js and Python and Swift and Perl and C and C++.  Also by all means budget for future reimplementations as whatever you've chosen goes out of fashion -- because that's the symptom being faced, languages go out of fashion.  Lather, rinse, repeat, and don't forget the _incredible_ risk associated with rewriting your application portfolio simply because the language it's written in is no longer in the [TIOBE top pick-your-number](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

Let's not forget that COBOL, as out of fashion and out of date as it is perceived to be, seems to be able to do arithmetic with dollar amounts with no difficulty.  If you're going to rewrite in something more "modern," don't forget to [avoid doing arithmetic with floating point](https://medium.com/@bellmar/is-cobol-holding-you-hostage-with-math-5498c0eb428b).

My choice to put "modern" in quote marks is to emphasize that "modern" seems to be the adulatory form of "semicolons and curly braces," because that's what's really being put forth as "modern."  It's C#, Java, and JavaScript, the latter two created in the previous century, the first initially released in mid-2000.  "Modern" indeed, Java is older than this year's university graduates.

If you've got a mainframe application portfolio, it's likely to be written in COBOL or PL/I, and it's just not that hard to find or grow the expertise.  Not all programming languages are descended from some ur-semicolons-and-curly-braces language; I'm pretty sure COBOL is unique in its syntax, RPG has a few fellows in its intemperate column dependency, and PL/I has the advantage of incorporating semicolons so maybe it will seem more familiar.  JCL is so arcane it's almost fun.

But the idea that you can run your COBOL source code through a converter and have a maintainable Java code base is a fantasy.  I know there are claims it has been done (_cough_ [naca](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1029974/experience-migrating-legacy-cobol-pl1-to-java/1061829#1061829) _cough_), but what I've seen of the results fails the maintainability test.  It can be done but it requires careful planning, coordination with the business areas, industrial strength tools (many of which reside in the squishy bits between developers ears), and a willingness to completely retool your IT shop and retrain your existing staff who have all the knowledge of the actual business in which your organization engages.

I am painfully aware that I'm open to accusation of being [the first kind of fool](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/02/02/old-good/); my point is not that everything old is automatically good but rather that that second kind of fool is, in fact, a fool.  Replacing your application portfolio because the technology is unpopular according to some metric which doesn't take technical applicability to the problem space into account is not a good idea.

And can we please learn from Arthur C. Clarke's 1951 short story [Superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superiority_(short_story)).  

The real choice you must make is between a good night's sleep and an endless series of midnight disasters due to ham-fisted corner-cutting fashion-chasing "modernization" efforts.
